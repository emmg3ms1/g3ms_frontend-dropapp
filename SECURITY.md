# Security Configuration Guide

## Implemented Security Fixes

### 1. Sensitive Data Logging
- ✅ Removed token exposure from console logs in production
- ✅ Added development-only logging for debugging
- ✅ Masked sensitive user data in logs

### 2. Enhanced Security Monitoring
- ✅ Created comprehensive security event logging system
- ✅ Added monitoring for login attempts, session timeouts, and suspicious activity
- ✅ Implemented rate limiting with security event integration

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Enhanced XSS protection with comprehensive input sanitization
- ✅ Added email validation and password strength checking
- ✅ Implemented request sanitization in API service

### 4. CORS Security
- ✅ Tightened CORS configuration in edge functions
- ✅ Environment-based origin restrictions
- ✅ Added security headers for CORS requests

### 5. Token Storage Security
- ✅ Added production warnings for localStorage usage
- ✅ Implemented framework for secure httpOnly cookies
- ✅ Enhanced token refresh error handling with security monitoring

## Next Steps for Production

### High Priority
1. **Implement httpOnly Cookies**: Replace localStorage with server-side httpOnly cookies
2. **External Security Monitoring**: Integrate with services like Sentry or LogRocket
3. **Security Headers**: Add comprehensive security headers via server configuration

### Medium Priority
4. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers
5. **Rate Limiting on Server**: Add server-side rate limiting
6. **Security Auditing**: Regular penetration testing

### Environment Variables
Required for enhanced security:
```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-production-domain.com
SECURITY_MONITORING_ENDPOINT=https://your-monitoring-service.com/api/events
```

## Security Features Active

- ✅ Session timeout management (30 minutes)
- ✅ Input sanitization and validation
- ✅ Security event logging and monitoring
- ✅ CSRF token protection
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with information disclosure prevention
- ✅ Development vs production logging separation

## Monitoring Dashboard

Access security events programmatically:
```javascript
import { securityMonitor } from '@/utils/securityMonitoring';

// Get recent security events
const events = securityMonitor.getEvents(50);

// Check for suspicious activity
const suspicious = securityMonitor.checkForSuspiciousActivity();
```
